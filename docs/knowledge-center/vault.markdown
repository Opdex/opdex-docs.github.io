The vault is a part of the governance protocol, allowing CRS token holders to decide how governance tokens are distributed. It is funded for the first 4 years, then thereafter receives no further funding.

Governance tokens locked within the vault can only be released through successful proposals to create new certificates.

See [Proposals](doc:knowledge-center-vault-proposals) and [Certificates](doc:knowledge-center-vault-certificates) for more details.
