Staking is the act of depositing market governance tokens (ODX) into liquidity pools. The primary purpose of staking is to vote for liquidity mining within different liquidity pools. The top four liquidity pools by staking weight monthly will have governance token mining enabled.

When staking, users will also collect 0.05% of the 0.3% of transaction fees for participation. So during staking, you are actively voting for liquidity mining of that pool while collecting partial transaction fees.

Liquidity pools that have the governance token in the pair will not have staking enabled. For example, in the Opdex staking market, the ODX-CRS liquidity pool will not have staking capabilities because ODX is the staking token for the market. Instead, 100% of transaction fees in this pool will be collected by liquidity providers.

## Start Staking

To start staking, you must have the required governance token. In the primary Opdex staking market, the token needed for staking is the ODX token.

## Collect Staking Rewards

Staking rewards can be collected at any time without leaving your position. Staking rewards are in the form of OLPT which represents a percentage of the liquidity in the pool. OLPT rewards can be liquidated immediately so that the returned rewards to the user are the underlying CRS and SRC tokens within the liquidity pool.

For example, if a user is collecting rewards from the USDT-CRS pool, they can choose to receive OLPT rewards to use for mining, or to add to their providing position or the user can liquidate immediately and receive CRS and USDT tokens directly.

## Stop Staking

User's can stop staking at any time. When exiting a staking position, any rewards available will automatically be collected, with the option to liquidate collected OLPT immediate for the pools' underlying reserve tokens.
